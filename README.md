# wordle-game
Final project for OOJ 

A console version of Wordle. Guess the 5-letter word in 6 tries based on feedback for each guess. 

Functionality:

We implemented all the functionality we had planned to at the start of the project besides
making the keyboard buttons inputs to actually type into a guess. Other than that the project
runs cleanly and is a fully functioning Wordle implementation.
